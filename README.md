# Challenge

  Refactored the code from Module 3 under Module 4 for efficiency. The new AllStocksAnalysis subroutine collects data in 1 pass into 4 arrays using a ticker index to identify values between the arrays. The assignment states that no new functionality should be added however the client will use the spreadsheet to analysis more than a dozen stocks. For this reason, added code to dynamically populate the tickers array as it changes. Also, added functionality to grow the data arrays as the ticker array size changes.
